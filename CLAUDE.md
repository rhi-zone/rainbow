# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in the rainbow repository.

## Project Overview

Optics-based reactivity for the web. Lenses and prisms as first-class composable values; derived state as structural relationships rather than imperative synchronization.

Part of the [rhi ecosystem](https://rhi.zone).

## Architecture

The model should be language-agnostic — TypeScript is the deployment target, not the model. The algebra (lens, prism, traversal composition laws) should hold regardless of runtime.

- `src/` — library source
- `docs/` — VitePress documentation site

**The algebra is the artifact.** The laws governing lens/prism composition are not documentation — they are the design. Every decision should be evaluated against whether it preserves the laws.

**Model first, implementation second.** Get the types and laws right before optimizing.

**Runtime agnostic.** No Node-specific APIs in the core library. Runtime-specific adapters go in separate entry points.

## Development

```bash
nix develop          # Enter dev shell
bun install          # Install dependencies
bun run typecheck    # Type check
bun run test         # Run tests
bun run build        # Build library
cd docs && bun dev   # Local docs
```

If a tool appears missing, you are outside `nix develop`. Do not assume the tool is unavailable to the project.

## Context Is The Only Scarce Resource

Every byte that enters the main session stays in the main session for its entire lifetime. File contents, command output, search results, page text — once read, it lingers in cache and shapes every downstream token. There is no "just looking."

**All exploration runs in subagents.** Investigations, audits, deep dives, surveys, "let me check," "let me find" — if the purpose of a tool sequence is to find out something you don't yet know, it runs in a subagent. Renaming the activity does not change what it is. The subagent returns a distilled summary; the raw output stays in the subagent.

The main session holds only the durable artifacts you are producing: the edit, the commit, the doc update.

**Subagent model tiers:**
- Opus — design, architecture, any subagent that itself spawns subagents.
- Sonnet — implementation, mechanical multi-file work, default exploration.

Use Opus for exploration only when the search requires architectural judgment, not lookup.

## Durability

Subagent reports, mid-session realizations, "I'll remember this" — none of these outlast the session. Anything worth keeping goes into CLAUDE.md, code, docs, or a commit. If it isn't written down, it is gone.

**Commit completed work immediately.** After tests pass, commit. After each phase of a multi-phase plan, commit. Uncommitted work is lost work, and accumulated uncommitted phases lose isolation as well.

**Docs change in the same commit as the code.** New pages enter the sidebar in that commit. There is no follow-up.

## Authenticity

When asked to analyze X, read X. Do not synthesize from conversation memory, prior summaries, or what the file probably says. Claims must correspond to evidence produced this session.

**Something unexpected is a signal.** Surprising output, anomalous numbers, a file containing what it shouldn't — stop and find out why. Do not accept the anomaly and proceed.

## Discipline

Corrections from the user are conversation, not material for new rules. A single correction does not warrant a CLAUDE.md edit. Rules are added when a failure mode is observed repeatedly and the rule names the failure it prevents.

Do not announce actions ("I will now…"). Act.

## Workflow

When editing a file, read it once, plan all changes, and apply them in one pass.

`normalize view` gives structural outlines without pulling full file bodies into context:
```bash
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <file>
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <dir>
```

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`.

## Hard Constraints

- No `--no-verify`. Fix the issue or fix the hook.
- No interactive git (`git add -p`, `git add -i`, `git rebase -i`) — these block on stdin and hang.
- No assuming a tool is missing without checking `nix develop`.
- No coupling the core algebra to any specific runtime or framework.
