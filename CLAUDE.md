# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in the rainbow repository.

## Project Overview

Optics-based reactivity for the web. Lenses and prisms as first-class composable values; derived state as structural relationships rather than imperative synchronization.

Part of the [rhi ecosystem](https://rhi.zone).

## Architecture

The model should be language-agnostic — TypeScript is the deployment target, not the model. The algebra (lens, prism, traversal composition laws) should hold regardless of runtime.

- `src/` — library source
- `docs/` — VitePress documentation site

**The algebra is the artifact.** The laws governing lens/prism composition are not documentation — they are the design. Every decision should be evaluated against whether it preserves the laws.

**Model first, implementation second.** Get the types and laws right before optimizing.

**Runtime agnostic.** No Node-specific APIs in the core library. Runtime-specific adapters go in separate entry points.

## Development

```bash
nix develop          # Enter dev shell
bun install          # Install dependencies
bun run typecheck    # Type check
bun run test         # Run tests
bun run build        # Build library
cd docs && bun dev   # Local docs
```

## Workflow

When editing a file, read it once, plan all changes, and apply them in one pass.

`normalize view` gives structural outlines without pulling full file bodies into context:
```bash
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <file>
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <dir>
```

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`.

## Delegation

The main session is an orchestrator. Allowed actions: `Agent`/`Task*`/`AskUserQuestion`/plan-mode/`ScheduleWakeup`, and Bash limited to `git commit`, `git push`, `git status`, `git log --oneline`. Everything else delegates to a subagent. The hook is evidence of a prompting failure, not a behavioral guide. If a tool call hits the hook AT ALL, the prompt failed to prevent it. Delegate before the decision point, not after.

### Triggers

Before calling Read, Grep, Glob, or any Bash beyond the four git commands — stop. Dispatch an Agent instead.

Before editing any file — stop. Dispatch an Agent. This includes plan files in `~/.claude/plans/`: in plan mode, dispatch a subagent to write to the plan file; do not Write it yourself. The plan file's content must not enter main context.

When you need git context beyond status/log-oneline (a diff, a blame, a show) — dispatch an Agent.

When a tool call is denied by the hook — do not retry, do not narrate. Dispatch the equivalent Agent and continue.

When a code-modifying subagent returns — `git status`, then `git commit` before any user-facing reply.

Before dispatching an Agent that modifies code — scan your prompt for "do not commit" or "based on your findings". Delete them.

Before dispatching: if your prompt says "if you find", "based on your findings", or "as appropriate" — stop. Investigate first; dispatch with the decision made.

When you can't verify something — do not speculate or guess at file locations, names, or contents. Dispatch a Read subagent or ask. Confabulation is failure.

### Model Tiers

- Sonnet — exploration, lookup, mechanical multi-file edits, implementation, default.
- Opus — architectural judgment, design, subagents that themselves spawn subagents.

Always set `subagent_type` and `model` explicitly.

### Prompt Rules

- Never tell a subagent "do not commit." Code-modifying subagents commit their own work.
- Don't ask for a diff summary. After a code-modifying subagent, `git status` in main and dispatch a review Agent if you need to see the diff.
- Don't re-explain CLAUDE.md. Subagents inherit it.
- Cite locations by content ("the block that does X"), not line numbers — files shift between reads.
- Name files explicitly; don't outsource the grep.
- Match agent type to deliverable: `Explore` for lookup/search, `general-purpose` for reports and file-modifying work.
- On unsatisfying output, change something before retrying. Same prompt + same tier = same result.
- Dispatch independent subagents in parallel (multiple Agent blocks in one message).
- Pair `isolation: worktree` with `run_in_background: true`.
- Code-modifying subagents must verify their own changes before returning (re-read the diff, run tests, etc.). The orchestrator does not get a second pass with git diff — that's hook-blocked.

## Hard Constraints

- No Edit/Write/NotebookEdit in main. Plan files in `~/.claude/plans/` are written by subagents, not by main.
- No Read/Grep/Glob/NotebookRead in main. Delegate.
- No Bash in main beyond `git commit`, `git push`, `git status`, `git log --oneline`.
- No `--no-verify`. Fix the issue or fix the hook.
- No path dependencies in `Cargo.toml` — they couple repos and break independent publishing.
- No interactive git (no `git rebase -i`, no `git add -i`, no `--no-edit` on rebase).
- No suggesting project names. LLMs are bad at this; refine the conceptual space only.
- No tracking cross-project issues in conversation — they go in TODO.md in the affected repo.
- No ecosystem changes without checking all affected repos.
- No assuming a tool is missing without checking `nix develop`.
- Commit completed work in the same turn it finishes. Uncommitted work is lost work.

## Meta

- Something unexpected is a signal. Stop and find out why. Do not accept the anomaly and proceed.
- Corrections from the user are conversation, not material for new rules. Rules are added when a failure mode is observed repeatedly.
