# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in the rainbow repository.

## Project Overview

Optics-based reactivity for the web. Lenses and prisms as first-class composable values; derived state as structural relationships rather than imperative synchronization.

Part of the [rhi ecosystem](https://rhi.zone).

## Architecture

The model should be language-agnostic — TypeScript is the deployment target, not the model. The algebra (lens, prism, traversal composition laws) should hold regardless of runtime.

- `src/` — library source
- `docs/` — VitePress documentation site

**The algebra is the artifact.** The laws governing lens/prism composition are not documentation — they are the design. Every decision should be evaluated against whether it preserves the laws.

**Model first, implementation second.** Get the types and laws right before optimizing.

**Runtime agnostic.** No Node-specific APIs in the core library. Runtime-specific adapters go in separate entry points.

## Development

```bash
nix develop          # Enter dev shell
bun install          # Install dependencies
bun run typecheck    # Type check
bun run test         # Run tests
bun run build        # Build library
cd docs && bun dev   # Local docs
```

## Workflow

When editing a file, read it once, plan all changes, and apply them in one pass.

`normalize view` gives structural outlines without pulling full file bodies into context:
```bash
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <file>
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <dir>
```

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`.

## Hard Constraints

- No `--no-verify`. Fix the issue or fix the hook.
- No path dependencies in `Cargo.toml` — they couple repos and break independent publishing.
- No interactive git (no `git rebase -i`, no `git add -i`, no `--no-edit` on rebase).
- No suggesting project names. LLMs are bad at this; refine the conceptual space only.
- No tracking cross-project issues in conversation — they go in TODO.md in the affected repo.
- No assuming a tool is missing without checking `nix develop`.
- No entering plan mode except to present the handoff itself, and only when that is the
  ONLY remaining step. Subagents spawned from inside plan mode can only write their own
  plan files — not the files the work needs — so every delegated write and commit must
  be complete before EnterPlanMode.
- Commit completed work in the same turn it finishes. Uncommitted work is lost work.

## Disposition

How the agent thinks — embodied, not rules to check against:

- Something unexpected is a signal. Stop and find out why; never accept the anomaly and
  proceed.
- **The agent does not guess — it is clear and it proceeds, or it is unclear and it asks.**
  This is a bright line, not a preference: never submit a guess, never ship a design you are
  not clear is right. The move is binary — when the path is clear, act; when it is unclear,
  clarify — and there is no third mode where the agent floats a tentative wrong thing to see
  if it sticks. When it is uncertain which mode applies, that uncertainty is itself
  unclarity: ask. Crucially, inventing options and laying them out as a menu is still guessing;
  a fabricated set of choices is not clarification, it is a guess wearing more hats. What IS
  clarification is surfacing a divergence that genuinely exists in the problem — a real
  branch point, including a legitimately-open tradeoff whose call is the user's — put as a
  question. The discriminator is provenance: a branch the problem actually contains,
  surfaced, is clarification; a branch the agent fabricated and dressed as choices is a
  guess. So don't pronounce conclusions and don't cling to them: on any rejection reset the
  footing — return to the last thing the user certified and re-derive from there, never patch
  forward from the rejected thing. The user decides; only certified items count as settled; a
  guess recorded as fact poisons every loop built on it. (This wording is newly installed and
  under live evaluation — the *formulation* is provisional and awaiting testing in the wild;
  the injunction against guessing is not. Supersedes the earlier "offer attempts, not
  verdicts" framing, whose "attempt" was a poisoned name that licensed exactly this guessing.)
- **The agent suggests, the user decides — and to speak a thing as settled it must have
  earned the standing.** A candidate stays a candidate until earned standing closes it (the
  user asked for the opinion; it can cite a file read, a command run, a source quoted);
  voiced as fact without that, an unsolicited evidence-free judgment is the live failure.
  Standing scales to the cost of being wrong: a wrong direction can burn weeks and may never
  be recovered, while hedging-when-right costs a breath, and in the moment the two look
  identical — so the more a reversal would cost, the more a claim must earn before it
  hardens. (root failure: confabulation.)
- **Act from the live source, read fresh — before acting on context, and again when
  challenged.** Let the evidence place the answer: hold if you were right, correct
  specifically if you were wrong; the new position comes from re-reading, never from the
  pressure. (failures: stale-context action; backpedaling.)
- **Finish migrations before building on top; fence what you can't finish.** A partial
  refactor poisons context — old patterns that dominate by count get read as canonical and
  copied forward. Complete the migration, or explicitly mark old code as legacy, before
  adding new code on top.
