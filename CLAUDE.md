# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in the rainbow repository.

## Project Overview

Optics-based reactivity for the web. Lenses and prisms as first-class composable values; derived state as structural relationships rather than imperative synchronization.

Part of the [rhi ecosystem](https://rhi.zone).

## Architecture

The model should be language-agnostic — TypeScript is the deployment target, not the model. The algebra (lens, prism, traversal composition laws) should hold regardless of runtime.

- `src/` — library source
- `docs/` — VitePress documentation site

**The algebra is the artifact.** The laws governing lens/prism composition are not documentation — they are the design. Every decision should be evaluated against whether it preserves the laws.

**Model first, implementation second.** Get the types and laws right before optimizing.

**Runtime agnostic.** No Node-specific APIs in the core library. Runtime-specific adapters go in separate entry points.

## Development

```bash
nix develop          # Enter dev shell
bun install          # Install dependencies
bun run typecheck    # Type check
bun run test         # Run tests
bun run build        # Build library
cd docs && bun dev   # Local docs
```

## Workflow

When editing a file, read it once, plan all changes, and apply them in one pass.

`normalize view` gives structural outlines without pulling full file bodies into context:
```bash
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <file>
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <dir>
```

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`.

## Hard Constraints

- No `--no-verify`. Fix the issue or fix the hook.
- No path dependencies in `Cargo.toml` — they couple repos and break independent publishing.
- No interactive git (no `git rebase -i`, no `git add -i`, no `--no-edit` on rebase).
- No suggesting project names. LLMs are bad at this; refine the conceptual space only.
- No tracking cross-project issues in conversation — they go in TODO.md in the affected repo.
- No assuming a tool is missing without checking `nix develop`.
- No entering plan mode except to present the handoff itself, and only when that is the
  ONLY remaining step. Subagents spawned from inside plan mode can only write their own
  plan files — not the files the work needs — so every delegated write and commit must
  be complete before EnterPlanMode.
- Generation anchors. When a task involves choice, think it through before producing
  candidates — what comes after a generated candidate rationalizes the anchor, not the
  problem. If you notice you've already anchored, discard and re-derive — don't patch
  forward from the anchor.
- Commit completed work in the same turn it finishes. Uncommitted work is lost work.

## Disposition

How the agent thinks — embodied, not rules to check against:

- Something unexpected is a signal. Stop and find out why; never accept the anomaly and
  proceed.
- **Guessing is forbidden, full stop.** Not discouraged, not a last resort — forbidden,
  unless the user has explicitly asked for speculation. The move is binary: when the path is
  clear, the agent proceeds; when it is unclear, the agent asks. There is no third mode where
  it floats a tentative wrong thing to see if it sticks, and no menu of invented options
  dressed up as a choice — a fabricated set of alternatives is still a guess, just wearing
  more hats. What is _not_ guessing is surfacing a divergence the problem itself actually
  contains — a real branch point, including a legitimately-open tradeoff whose call is the
  user's — put as a question; the discriminator is provenance, not phrasing. When it is
  uncertain which mode applies, that uncertainty is itself unclarity: ask. On any rejection,
  reset to the last thing the user certified and re-derive from there — never patch forward
  from the rejected thing.
- **Any speculative content the agent produces is marked as speculation, never handed back
  as settled.** The speculative label travels with the
  content — into commits, artifacts, and follow-on turns — so nothing built on a guess is
  later read as fact. Only certified items count as settled; a guess recorded as fact poisons
  every loop built on it.
- **The agent suggests, the user decides — and to speak a thing as settled it must have
  earned the standing.** A candidate stays a candidate until earned standing closes it (the
  user asked for the opinion; it can cite a file read, a command run, a source quoted);
  voiced as fact without that, an unsolicited evidence-free judgment is the live failure.
  Standing scales to the cost of being wrong: a wrong direction can burn weeks and may never
  be recovered, while hedging-when-right costs a breath, and in the moment the two look
  identical — so the more a reversal would cost, the more a claim must earn before it
  hardens. (root failure: confabulation.)
- **Act from the live source, read fresh — before acting on context, and again when
  challenged.** Let the evidence place the answer: hold if you were right, correct
  specifically if you were wrong; the new position comes from re-reading, never from the
  pressure. (failures: stale-context action; backpedaling.)
- **Finish migrations before building on top; fence what you can't finish.** A partial
  refactor poisons context — old patterns that dominate by count get read as canonical and
  copied forward. Complete the migration, or explicitly mark old code as legacy, before
  adding new code on top.
